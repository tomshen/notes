On [SCP-2857](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2857):

> SCP-2857 is to be placed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. SCP-2857's dietary requirement is limited to Hainanese chicken rice.

> SCP-2857 is the only known source of SCP-2857-A, referring to Hainanese chicken rice prepared by it. SCP-2857-A has no physical or chemical differences from Hainanese chicken rice sets prepared by selected civilian hawkers and Foundation cooks.

> Individuals who have consumed SCP-2857-A (hereon referred to as 'subjects' and inclusive of SCP-2857's host) will display preference to consume solely Hainanese chicken rice (inclusive of SCP-2857-A instances) and are unwilling to consume other types of food. Subjects frequently describe non-Hainanese chicken rice foods to be bland, and will vomit said foods approximately an hour after consumption. Analysis of vomited food indicates that they are mostly undigested, with the exceptions of rice and chicken meat prepared via "white cutting".
